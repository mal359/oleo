TODO's:

* Increase "X" friendliness.
 - Make a LessTif/Motif interface

* Include texi2html in the oleo source, and enhance it so it can
  process all the texinfo commands used in the documentation.
  Currently @findex isn't supported, and @html is poorly supported.

* Use GNU PlotUtils instead of GnuPlot.
  In the process, make the plotting user interface more transparent.

Longer term TODO's :

* Import/Export Filters. (June 1/97 - JB)
 - Sylk may need fixing.
 - CSV would be nice
 - DBII or DBIII is useful.
 - Fixed width.

* Fix sort routines
