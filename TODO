TODO's:

* Get our stuff together for an upcoming 2.0 release of Oleo.

* Add "date" and "time" formats, allow them to be input and allow
  for arithmetic with them.
	(done) Clean up cell.h's junk.
	(done) Add FMT_DATE
	(done) check file I/O stuff against new date format
	(todo) document FMT_DATE, the various date representations
	(todo) allow for date input

* Increase "X" friendliness.
 - Make a LessTif/Motif interface
	(busy) printing
	(busy) GNU Plotutils dialogs

* Include texi2html in the oleo source, and enhance it so it can
  process all the texinfo commands used in the documentation.
  Currently @findex isn't supported, and @html is poorly supported.

* Use GNU PlotUtils instead of GnuPlot.
  This is being worked on : simple bar, pie, and XY charts are available.
  In the process, make the plotting user interface more transparent.

* Make io_error_msg work right in Motif.
	(done)

* Get i18n to work right.

* Figure out why having kinput2 present kills oleo.

* Get character mode oleo to work from a Motif executable.
	Exact bug description ?







Longer term or obsolete TODO's :

* Import/Export Filters. (June 1/97 - JB)
 - Sylk may need fixing.
 - CSV would be nice (update DB 10/2/1999: LIST format can do this)
 - DBII or DBIII is useful.
 - Fixed width.

* Fix sort routines
	(Nov 15/97 - Steve Fisk)

# Figure out why sort.c requires functions passed as args to a function
