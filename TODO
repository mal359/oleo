TODO's:

* Configuration
	fail on funky options --with-motif --without-Xbae

* Get our stuff together for an upcoming 2.0 release of Oleo.

* Add "date" and "time" formats, allow them to be input and allow
  for arithmetic with them.
	(done) Clean up cell.h's junk.
	(done) Add FMT_DATE
	(done) check file I/O stuff against new date format
	(todo) document FMT_DATE, the various date representations
	(todo) allow for date input

* Increase "X" friendliness.
 - Make a LessTif/Motif interface
	(busy) printing
	(busy) GNU Plotutils dialogs
	(todo) print dialog

* Include texi2html in the oleo source, and enhance it so it can
  process all the texinfo commands used in the documentation.
  Currently @findex isn't supported, and @html is poorly supported.

* Use GNU PlotUtils instead of GnuPlot.
  This is being worked on : simple bar, pie, and XY charts are available.
  In the process, make the plotting user interface more transparent.
	(todo) allow an empty range to be input without warnings
	(todo) port the plotutils user interface to curses (long term ?)

* Make io_error_msg work right in Motif.
	(done)

* Get i18n to work right.

* Figure out why having kinput2 present kills oleo.

* Get character mode oleo to work from a Motif executable.
	Exact bug description ?







Longer term or obsolete TODO's :

* Import/Export Filters. (June 1/97 - JB)
 - Sylk may need fixing.
 - CSV would be nice (DB 17/3/1999: LIST format can do this,
	now also recognizes CSV file name suffix)
 - DBII or DBIII is useful.
	(db 19/3/1999: XBASE library can do this. Somewhat implemented.)
 - Fixed width.

* Fix sort routines
	(Nov 15/97 - Steve Fisk)

# Figure out why sort.c requires functions passed as args to a function
	(03-14/1998 - JB)
