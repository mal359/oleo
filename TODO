TODO's:

* Configuration
 	(done) fail on funky options --with-motif --without-Xbae
	(done) make sure C++ stuff doesn't break non-Xbase compiles
		Unfortunately: can't get this to work. Hence :
	(done) Once automake supports it, use Xbase by default.

* Printing
	(todo) parameterize printing
	(todo) make printing more intelligent
	(todo) printing large region shows a scaling bug.
	       Try printing A1:AZ255.
	(todo) implement PCL printing (see www.wotsit.org)
	(todo) improve appearance of PostScript prints
	(todo) fix precision handling in prints

* Get our stuff together for an upcoming 2.0 release of Oleo.

* Add "date" and "time" formats, allow them to be input and allow
  for arithmetic with them.
	(done) Clean up cell.h's junk.
	(done) Add FMT_DATE
	(done) check file I/O stuff against new date format
	(todo) document FMT_DATE, the various date representations
	(todo) allow for date input

* Increase "X" friendliness.
 - Make a LessTif/Motif interface
	(busy) printing
	(busy) GNU Plotutils dialogs
	(todo) print dialog
	 ****  which range is the complete spreadsheet
		-> (io-motif.c ReallyPrintCB)
	 ****  allow selecting what format to print (not only PostScript ?)
	(todo) make selecting cells and ranges more user friendly

* Include texi2html in the oleo source, and enhance it so it can
  process all the texinfo commands used in the documentation.
  Currently @findex isn't supported, and @html is poorly supported.

* Use GNU PlotUtils instead of GnuPlot.
  This is being worked on : simple bar, pie, and XY charts are available.
  In the process, make the plotting user interface more transparent.
	(done) allow an empty range to be input without warnings
	(todo) port the plotutils user interface to curses (long term ?)
	(todo) Allow manual setting of axis ranges in various plots.
	(todo) 3D pie
	(todo) exploding pie
	(todo) implement plotutils in XmScrolledWindow
	(todo) ticks on axes in several plot types
	(todo) figure out how to print on monochrome printers

* Integrate GSL (Gnu Scientific Library).
  The GSL is a collection of routines for numerical analysis,
  which we happen to be lacking in Oleo.

* Import/Export Filters.
 - SYLK
	(done) don't flunk out on reading Excel files
	(todo) translate SYLK options into Oleo options
	(done) translate SYLK functions into Oleo functions (SUM -> sum)
	(todo) add all known functions to the function tranlation table
	(done) interpret SYLK ranges right
		SYLK says RC[-2]:RC[-1], Oleo says rc[-2:-1]
	(todo) interpret boundaries
	(todo) interpret fill patterns
	(todo) ...
	(todo) make this list more complete

 - CSV would be nice (DB 17/3/1999: LIST format can do this,
	now also recognizes CSV file name suffix)
 - DBII or DBIII is useful.
	(db 19/3/1999: XBASE library can do this. Somewhat implemented.)
 - Fixed width.

* Make io_error_msg work right in Motif.
	(done)

* Get i18n to work right.

* Figure out why having kinput2 present kills oleo.

* Get character mode oleo to work from a Motif executable.
	Exact bug description ?

* Build a graph to figure out in which order to recalculate, then
  also use it to speed up recalculation.
  In the process, make sure we update a cell a determinable number of
  times (1 for instance) per recalculation.
	(todo) build graph
	(todo) use graph in recalculation
	(todo) examples/loop.oleo : cell A3 increases with 123, not 1,
		at every recalculation.




Longer term or obsolete TODO's :

* Fix sort routines
	(Nov 15/97 - Steve Fisk)

# Figure out why sort.c requires functions passed as args to a function
	(03-14/1998 - JB)
