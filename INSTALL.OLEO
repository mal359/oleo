This file contains installation instructions specific to Oleo.  Before
reading this file, you should be familiar with the generic
installation instructions in the file INSTALL.

* Configuring the size of spreadsheets.

* Compiling X11 support.

configure searches a number of directories for X11 libraries and
header files.

If configure finds the header file `<X11/X.h>', Oleo will be compiled
with support X11 in addition to the usual terminal interface.  `-lX11'
will be added to the list of libraries.  (Additional include
directories and library path directories may be added as well).

If the X header files are in an unusual location, you may need to run
configure with a command like:

  $ DEFS='-I$X_INCLUDE_DIR' configure

To compile without X support, edit the Makefile to remove
`-DHAVE_X11_X_H=1' from the definition of `ALL_CFLAGS'.
