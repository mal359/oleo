Welcome to the Alpha Oleo tree...

If you want to get debug information sent to stderr while you're running
this, use the --enable-debug command on configure.  Otherwise, Oleo
will attempt to compile itself in as much of a production-environment
way as possible.

Known problems with this code are outlined in the files README, FAQ
and TODO.

If you are GNU friendly, you can check out this repository from its home at
/gd/gnu/cvsroot.  Otherwise, you will find new releases under
alpha.gnu.org/gnu/oleo.

Thanks,

The Maintainers
