Welcome to the Alpha Oleo tree...

If you want to get debug information sent to stderr while you're running
this, use the --enable-debug command on configure.  Otherwise, Oleo
will attempt to compile itself in as much of a production-environment
way as possible.

Apparently the sort routine is hooped, but there's other memory corruptions
that I've decided to worry about first.  The reason I'm doing the GTK
interface before anything else is because I want an interface that works
well.

If you are GNU friendly you can check out this repository from it's home
at /gd/gnu/cvsroot - Otherwise, you will find periodical updates on 
alpha.gnu.org/gnu/oleo.  Those are updated as frequently as I get to it.

Tks,
Jeff Bailey
