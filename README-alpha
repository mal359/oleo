Welcome to the Alpha Oleo tree..  There's a lot of stuff hapenning in here
right now, now the least of which is a serious re-org.

IF you happened to be silly enough to check this out, I strongly advise
checking the configure switches that I've got.  --without-gtk might be
a particularily good one to chose at this point.

Apparently the sort routine is hooped, but there's other memory corruptions
that I've decided to worry about first.  The reason I'm doing the GTK
interface before anything else is because I want an interface that works
well.

I am not looking for patches for now.  I have new documentation to merge in
and that's great, but I'm only checking in updates when they compile, and that
may require changes on the several core files.  That said, it _is_ worth
e-mailing me if you notice problems.  I'll even have the email addresses 
working soon. =)

If you are GNU friendly you can check out this repository from it's home
at /gd/gnu/cvsroot - Otherwise, you will find periodical updates on 
alpha.gnu.org/gnu/oleo.  Those are updated as frequently as I get to it.

Tks,
Jeff Bailey
