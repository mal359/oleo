Welcome to GNU Oleo!  Aiming to be the FREE-world's hottest spreadsheet
package.  By free world, of course, I am referring to the freedom that
comes with the GNU Copyleft.  For more information see the file 
COPYING included with this distribution.

This distribution tries to meet the GNU standards for package distribution,
and as such you can expect to find files such as NEWS, ChangeLog, README,
COPYING, etc. in their usual places.  Official(tm) released versions can
also be found at ftp.gnu.org, or some nearby mirror.

If this package has README-alpha file in it's top level, you are looking
at an ALPHA version of Oleo.  This means that unless you're brave and
_really_ need to test my bugs on your system, you should find a release
version.  Otherwise, please consult the README-alpha file for up-to-date
information as to what's going on.

Why a Spreadsheet
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Most people don't remember back to the gold old days of computers.  I'm
not referring to when you had to use that *extremely* slow 14.4k modem, 
but back when computers began to become popular in business environments.
Most history books that I've read (which, adminitedly, is three), say that
accountants brought computers into business with the creation of spreadsheet
packages.  Being able to map out formulas on a grid was too much for the 'ol
bean counters to pass up, and so out the machines came.  

Year 2000
-=-=-=-=-

As GNU Oleo is free software, there is no guarantee that this package
is year-2000 safe.  There are several places where 2-digit dates may
indeed be used internally.  However, being based on the GNU Libc, it
is likely that it will be year 2000 safe once a quick pass is made to
ensure that it uses standard date functions.  Most unix systems use a
32-bit date field, which give us until the year 2030 or so to find a better
solution.  The likely hood is that all systems will be _at least_ 64 bit
by then, alleviating all the pressure.

This still poses an interesting problem for future modelling, as this means
that you should NOT expect this version of Oleo to be able to calculate, say,
50 or 100 year investment bonds.  This is a serious limitation, and is being
looked at.

Components Required
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

GNU Oleo is what I like to refer to as a "top of the food chain" application.
Many other packages are required to ensure full functionality.  Among those
that are required:

* some version of curses (NCurses or Termcap/curses)
* GNU Gettext 0.10.32 (currently included in oleo)
* Motif or LessTif if you want the Motif GUI (incomplete)
* Gtk+ if you want the Gnome GUI (very incomplete)

That GNU Oleo is strongly dependant on those applications is a clear
indication of my lack of desire to support these applications myself.
I have not included these by default, and expect the installer to have
them on hand, or accept that Oleo's functionality may be decreased.

Parlez-Vous francais?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

GNU Oleo is going international!  Internationalization is complete,
and localization is on it's way.  If you want to help, please read
ABOUT-NLS, and consider getting involved in a GNU translation effort.

Getting Help and Reporting Bugs
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

There is a mailing list set up for your convenience:

	bug-oleo@gnu.org

Please remember a couple quick points when emailing these lists:

	o Oleo suffered a long period of inactivity.  It's popularity is just
	  beginning to increase again.

	o We're all volunteers, be nice =)

	o More detail is good.  Suggestions as to what you think the problem
	  might be are also good.

	o Please make sure you're running a recent version before reporting the
	  bug. Excessively old version won't be patched if the fix already
	  exists in a more recent version.
